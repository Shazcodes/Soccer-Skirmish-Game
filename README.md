# Soccer Skirmish Game

This is a private project developed for my personal resume.

## Overview

Soccer Skirmish Game is a web-based game where players control a soccer player and try to dodge incoming soccer balls. The game's difficulty can be adjusted, and players are scored based on the time they survive without being hit by a ball.

## Features

### 1. Interactive Canvas

The game is played on a 500x500 canvas where the player's icon and soccer balls are rendered. Players can move the soccer player icon using the mouse.
